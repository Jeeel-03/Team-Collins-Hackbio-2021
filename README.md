# Team-Collins-Hackbio-2021
##In Stage 1 of HackBio Internship_2021, our task was to perform analysis on a genomic dataset using various bioinformatic tools of our choice. Malaria is a disease caused by parasitic protozoans in the genus Plasmodium, which are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by female mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles. The predominant malaria parasite species that infect humans are Plasmodium falciparum (Neafsey et al., 2021) and our team agreed to work on Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) [2]. The objective of our analysis was to evaluate variations in the genome sequence with the reference by [3] performing a variant call analysis.
